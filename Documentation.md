The Photo Capture application is a .NET application that enhances the ability to capture a portion of screen by giving you more option on how the captured screen is output to the final file or else how the layout of the file exported will be.  The photocapture unlike other photo capturing tools, allows you to take snapshot and also lets you resize the captured image at runtime.

When you open the PhotoCapture application, you will be provided with 3 options. 

# Take Snapshot : This option is used to take a random snapshot of the screen. This option automatically minimizes the application and allows you to take capture of the screen. You are allowed to resize the image by holding the resizer available during capture. 
# Browse Files : This option will let you to browse a file using File browser and allows you to choose files from the file system. These files will get opened by the application during the capture and will help you to capture a portion of the file you wanted to take capture. 
# Options : Options let you to define various options that you might need to output the application. You can specify the options from Command line too, but more precisely this is an GUI to define options that could be used to output the capture.

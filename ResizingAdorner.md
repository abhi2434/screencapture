The ResizingAdorner places adorners on the screen capture utility which helps to resize a capture during Runtime. The tool places 5 adorners on 4 corners and one at the center of the capture whcih lets you resize the capture even after it is taken.


The Capture will finally execute when you double click on the capture area after Adorner is set.
